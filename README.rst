Module extends the Odoo Project app and introduces the following additional features.

1. Default grouping of tasks by task owners
2. Introduced new fields on both projects and tasks to capture and share the following open tasks, delayed tasks, and finished tasks (current month, and past week)
3. Ability to generate a report in HTML

**Note**: The webservice feature to expose the task data in JSON format was not
implemented due to time constraints.
